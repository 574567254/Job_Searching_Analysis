# Job_Searching_Analysis
### This project aims to provide job searching strategy for new graduates who are interested in data-related positions (i.e. data analyst, data scientist, business analyst). 

The confusing nature of the data-related job market comes from the fact that data-related careers are newly introduced, and many companies have different definitions of the roles and responsibilities of data specialists in their organizations. Therefore, this project will explore the "tangible criteria for job hunting" through text analysis of job postings to improve job search efficiency.

In the following analysis, two key questions will be addressed to tackle the problem:
1. Which job positions should we apply for when considering our skillsets?
   - What kind of differences exist between different data-related positions, such as data analyst, data scientist, and business analyst?
2. Which industry can we possibly target while searching for a job?
   - Which industry has the most demand for data-related positions?
   - Which industries have the highest similarity regarding to the requirements of data-related positions so that we can target concurrently?
